I chose this dataset regarding the prediction of heart faiure because many of my family members andincluding people I know are at risk of this. I'm curious of what causes people to be more at risk of this condition, whether it's the cholestrole, blood pressure, and other data that may affect the riskof recieving heart failure. wnat to take this oppurtunity to educate myself and possibly educate others in order to prevent this and take better care of ourselves.

Questions I hope to answer:
1. Which age is most common to recieve heart failure and whether sex is connected?
2. Which common Chest paintype is most common?
3. What is the highest and lowest cholesterol level people have when they recieve heart failure?
4. Which sex is most common to recieve heart failure?
5. what is the highest and lowest Max Heart Rate(MaxHR)?
6. What is the highest and lowest resting blood rate(RestingBP)?
7. People who have heart failure have more normal Resting ECG?
8. Which age is most affected by heart failure?
9. What is exercise Angina and how many people answered Yes and No.
